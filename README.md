## Introduction  

Network intrusion detection is a critical component of cybersecurity. This project focuses on managing and preprocessing network intrusion datasets to build models that can identify suspicious activities in a network. The repository is designed to provide a flexible framework for data input, transformation, and export.  

---

## Features  

- Data ingestion from multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)  
- Preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and feature engineering  
- Support for exporting cleaned datasets for machine learning purposes  
- Easy integration into other network intrusion detection systems  

---

## Technologies Used  

- *Python*: Core programming language  
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation  
- *NumPy*: For numerical computations  
- *Matplotlib/Seaborn*: For data visualization  
- *Scikit-learn*: For basic preprocessing tasks

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/NaiduBM/Network-Intrusion-Data-Input.git  

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd Network-Intrusion-Data-Input  


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Usage
	1.	Prepare the dataset: Place your raw dataset files in the data/ directory.
	2.	Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocess.py  


	3.	The cleaned and transformed data will be saved in the output/ folder for further analysis.
